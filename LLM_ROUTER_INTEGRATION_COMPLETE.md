  - **Search Services (2)**: perplexica, searxng
  - **Database Services (1)**: neo4j
  - **Monitoring Services (3)**: ai_monitor, grafana, prometheus
  - **Tools (2)**: port_scanner, genai_stack_loader
  - **Infrastructure (1)**: webhook_server
  - **API (1)**: ai_gateway
  - **Web UI (4)**: windmill, restaurant_network_voice, network_management_voice, network_hub

- **Service Capabilities**:
  - Health monitoring with multiple endpoint checks
  - Startup command management (Python, Node.js, .NET, vLLM, Docker, systemd)
  - Specialty matching for intelligent routing
  - Performance metrics and cost optimization
  - Service type classification and filtering

### 2. Enhanced Platform-Aware Router (`platform_aware_router.py`)

- **Intelligent Task Classification**: 
  - Reasoning, coding, creative, general tasks
  - Multi-agent collaboration, research, search
  - Graph queries, network scanning, local LLM preferences
- **Advanced Routing Logic**:
  - Complexity analysis (simple ‚Üí expert)
  - Specialty matching with scoring
  - Service availability checking
  - Cost-aware routing with budget factors
  - Fallback service selection

### 3. Complete Startup Management

#### Boot Startup Script (`startup-all-services.sh`)
- **8-Phase Intelligent Startup Sequence**:
  1. Infrastructure Services (webhook-server)
  2. Core Backend Services (chat-copilot-backend)
  3. AI Stack Services (ai-gateway, ai-monitor)
  4. vLLM Services (reasoning, general, coding with GPU detection)
  5. Agent Services (autogen-studio, magentic-one)
  6. Utility Services (port-scanner)
  7. Docker Services (neo4j, grafana, prometheus, perplexica)
  8. Network Management Services (voice interfaces, network hub)

- **Advanced Features**:
  - Service health monitoring with wait loops
  - GPU detection and CUDA device assignment
  - PID management for all services
  - Comprehensive logging to individual log files
  - Service dependency management
  - Graceful startup/shutdown procedures

#### Systemd Integration (`ai-research-platform.service`)
- **Automatic Boot Startup**: Full platform starts automatically at boot
- **Service Management**: systemctl integration for start/stop/restart
- **Failure Recovery**: Automatic restart on service failure
- **User Permissions**: Runs as keith user with proper environment
- **Resource Management**: GPU access, memory management
- **Logging**: Integrated with systemd journal

#### Installation Script (`install-boot-services.sh`)
- **One-Command Installation**: `sudo ./install-boot-services.sh`
- **Service Management**: Enable/disable boot startup
- **Status Monitoring**: Comprehensive service status reporting
- **Journal Integration**: Easy log access and monitoring

## üöÄ Current System Status

### Service Health (Latest Check)
- **Online Services**: 11/24 (45.8%)
- **LLM Services**: 1/6 online (ollama)
- **Agent Services**: 3/4 online (chat_copilot, autogen_studio, magentic_one)
- **Search Services**: 1/2 online (searxng)
- **Infrastructure**: AI Gateway running and routing requests

### Active Routing Endpoints
- **AI Gateway**: `http://localhost:9000/health` ‚úÖ
- **Enhanced Routing**: `http://localhost:9000/router/optimal-model` ‚úÖ
- **Platform Routing**: `http://localhost:9000/platform/route` ‚úÖ
- **Service Analytics**: `http://localhost:9000/platform/analytics` ‚úÖ
- **Comprehensive Health**: `http://localhost:9000/platform/services` ‚úÖ

## üìä Routing Intelligence Examples

### Task-Based Routing
```bash
# Reasoning Task
curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/router/optimal-model \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "Solve: 2x + 5 = 17", "task_type": "reasoning"}'
# ‚Üí Routes to reasoning service (port 8000)

# Network Management Task  
curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/platform/route \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "Help with FortiManager", "task_type": "network_scan"}'
# ‚Üí Routes to appropriate network service
```

### Service Discovery
```bash
# Get all startup commands
./scripts/platform-management/startup-all-services.sh commands

# Check comprehensive service health
./scripts/platform-management/startup-all-services.sh status

# View service analytics
curl http://localhost:9000/platform/analytics | jq
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Usage

### Quick Setup
```bash
# Make LLM router aware of all services
cd /home/keith/chat-copilot

# Test current integration
curl http://localhost:9000/platform/services | jq

# Install boot services (optional)
sudo ./scripts/platform-management/install-boot-services.sh

# Start all services manually
./scripts/platform-management/startup-all-services.sh start

# Check service status
./scripts/platform-management/startup-all-services.sh status
```

### Systemd Management (if installed)
```bash
# Start platform
sudo systemctl start ai-research-platform.service

# Enable boot startup
sudo systemctl enable ai-research-platform.service

# Check status
sudo systemctl status ai-research-platform.service

# View logs
sudo journalctl -u ai-research-platform.service -f
```
