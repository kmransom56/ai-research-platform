## ✅ **What's Ready to Test**

### FortiManager Configurations Detected:
- **Arby's**: 10.128.144.132 (ibadmin)
- **Buffalo Wild Wings**: 10.128.145.4 (ibadmin)  
- **Sonic**: 10.128.156.36 (ibadmin)

### Enhanced Features Implemented:
- ✅ Your proven FortiManager API from GitHub integrated
- ✅ Restaurant-specific device classification
- ✅ Multi-vendor discovery (Meraki + Fortinet)
- ✅ Enhanced voice interface with Fortinet commands
- ✅ Neo4j database schema for Fortinet devices
- ✅ Automated organization detection

---

## 🚀 **Testing Commands (When on Corporate Network)**

### 1. Test Individual FortiManager Connections
```bash
cd /home/keith/chat-copilot
source neo4j-env/bin/activate
python3 network-agents/fortimanager_api.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```
🔍 Testing Arby's FortiManager: 10.128.144.132
✅ Successfully connected to Arby's FortiManager
📊 Found X managed devices
🛡️  Device Types: {'FortiGate': X, 'FortiAP': X}
🍽️  Restaurant Roles: {'Store Firewall': X, 'Customer WiFi': X}

🔍 Testing Buffalo Wild Wings FortiManager: 10.128.145.4
✅ Successfully connected to Buffalo Wild Wings FortiManager
📊 Found X managed devices

🔍 Testing Sonic FortiManager: 10.128.156.36
✅ Successfully connected to Sonic FortiManager
📊 Found X managed devices

🎯 OVERALL RESTAURANT NETWORK SUMMARY
📊 Total Fortinet Devices: XXX
📊 Total Online: XXX
📊 Overall Health: XX.X%
```

### 2. Run Multi-Vendor Discovery
```bash
python3 network-agents/multi-vendor-discovery.py
```

This will discover and load:
- All Meraki devices (existing functionality)
- All Fortinet devices from all 3 FortiManagers
- Restaurant organization classification
- Device role assignment

### 3. Test Enhanced Voice Interface
```bash
python3 network-agents/enhanced-voice-interface.py
```

Then access: http://localhost:11033

**Voice Commands to Test:**
- *"Show Fortinet devices"*
- *"How is Arby's network?"*
- *"Buffalo Wild Wings security status"*
- *"Check Sonic firewalls"*
- *"How many FortiGate devices do we have?"*

### 4. Start Complete Multi-Vendor System
```bash
./start-multi-vendor-network-system.sh
```

Access points:
- Main Dashboard: http://localhost:11040
- Enhanced Voice: http://localhost:11033
- Neo4j Browser: http://localhost:7474

## 📊 **Expected Data Structure**

### Restaurant Organizations
When connected, you should see devices automatically classified:

**Arby's FortiManager (10.128.144.132):**
- Organization: "Arby's"
- Device roles: Store Firewall, Customer WiFi, POS Network
- Site: "arbys"

**Buffalo Wild Wings FortiManager (10.128.145.4):**
- Organization: "Buffalo Wild Wings"  
- Device roles: Store Firewall, Staff WiFi, Kitchen Network
- Site: "bww"

**Sonic FortiManager (10.128.156.36):**
- Organization: "Sonic"
- Device roles: Store Firewall, Customer WiFi, Kitchen Operations
- Site: "sonic"

### Neo4j Data Model
```cypher
// Fortinet devices with restaurant classification
MATCH (d:Device {vendor: 'Fortinet'})
RETURN d.organization, d.device_type, d.restaurant_role, count(d)
ORDER BY d.organization, d.device_type
```

---

## 🎤 **Voice Command Examples**

### Multi-Vendor Queries
- *"How many devices do we have?"* → Shows Meraki + Fortinet totals
- *"Device count by vendor"* → Breaks down by Meraki vs Fortinet
- *"Network health overview"* → Combined health across all vendors

### Restaurant-Specific Queries  
- *"How is Arby's network?"* → Shows both Meraki and Fortinet devices for Arby's
- *"Buffalo Wild Wings device status"* → BWW-specific inventory
- *"Sonic security devices"* → Sonic FortiGate firewalls

### Security-Focused Queries
- *"How are our firewalls?"* → All security devices across vendors
- *"Show critical security issues"* → Offline FortiGates prioritized
- *"Fortinet device health"* → Fortinet-specific health summary

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting Corporate Network Issues**

## 🔒 **SSL & Zscaler Corporate Network Support**

### NEW: Corporate Network SSL Fixes

I've integrated SSL helper scripts to handle corporate network environments:

**SSL Universal Fix Features:**
- ✅ Bypasses Zscaler SSL certificate issues
- ✅ Configures corporate proxy settings
- ✅ Handles self-signed certificates
- ✅ Custom requests session for FortiManager
- ✅ Comprehensive SSL diagnostics

### Corporate Network Testing

**Quick SSL Test:**
```bash
cd network-agents
source neo4j-env/bin/activate
python3 ssl_universal_fix.py
```

**Comprehensive Corporate Network Test:**
```bash
python3 test_corporate_network.py
```

This will test:
1. ✅ SSL fixes application
2. ✅ Zscaler environment configuration  
3. ✅ FortiManager-specific patches
4. ✅ Connectivity to all 3 FortiManager instances
5. ✅ Authentication and device discovery
6. ✅ Generate detailed diagnostic report

### Connection Issues Troubleshooting

If you get timeouts when connected to corporate network:

1. **Run Corporate Network Test:**
   ```bash
   python3 network-agents/test_corporate_network.py
   ```

2. **Check Specific FortiManager:**
   ```bash
   python3 -c "
   from network-agents.ssl_universal_fix import test_ssl_connectivity
   results = test_ssl_connectivity('10.128.144.132')  # Arby's
   for test, result in results['tests'].items():
       print(f'{test}: {result}')
   "
   ```

3. **SSL Diagnostics:**
   ```bash
   python3 -c "
   from network-agents.ssl_universal_fix import print_ssl_diagnostics
   print_ssl_diagnostics()
   "
   ```

### Environment Variables
Verify credentials are loaded:
```bash
python3 -c "
import sys
sys.path.append('network-agents')
from fortimanager_api import load_env_file
import os
load_env_file()
print('Arby FortiManager:', os.getenv('ARBYS_FORTIMANAGER_HOST'))
print('BWW FortiManager:', os.getenv('BWW_FORTIMANAGER_HOST'))  
print('Sonic FortiManager:', os.getenv('SONIC_FORTIMANAGER_HOST'))
"
```

### Debug Mode
Enable verbose logging:
```bash
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
python3 network-agents/fortimanager_api.py
```

## 📈 **Performance Expectations**

### Device Discovery Scale
Based on typical restaurant deployments:

**Arby's (1000+ locations):**
- ~2000-3000 FortiGate firewalls
- ~3000-5000 FortiAP access points
- Store + corporate infrastructure

**Buffalo Wild Wings (1200+ locations):**  
- ~2500-3500 FortiGate devices
- ~4000-6000 FortiAP devices
- Sports bar WiFi infrastructure

**Sonic (3500+ locations):**
- ~7000-10000 FortiGate devices
- ~10000-15000 FortiAP devices
- Drive-thru and customer WiFi

**Total Expected: 15,000-25,000 Fortinet devices**

### Discovery Time
- Per FortiManager: 2-5 minutes
- All three sites: 10-15 minutes
- Neo4j loading: 5-10 minutes
- Total system startup: 20-30 minutes

## 🎯 **Success Indicators**

When testing on corporate network, you should see:

1. ✅ **Successful FortiManager logins** to all 3 sites
2. ✅ **Device counts** in the thousands per restaurant chain
3. ✅ **Organization detection** correctly identifying restaurant brands
4. ✅ **Role classification** assigning restaurant-specific roles
5. ✅ **Voice commands** responding with Fortinet device data
6. ✅ **Neo4j database** populated with multi-vendor topology
7. ✅ **Network visualization** showing Fortinet devices with red icons
