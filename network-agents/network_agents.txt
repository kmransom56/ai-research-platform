● Neo4j Graph Schema for Network Management:

  // Device Nodes
  CREATE (device:NetworkDevice {
    id: "MX-12345",
    type: "Meraki_MX",
    model: "MX68",
    firmware: "17.10.2",
    location: "HQ-DataCenter",
    management_ip: "192.168.1.1"
  })

  // Relationships
  CREATE (device1)-[:CONNECTS_TO {port: "WAN1", bandwidth: "1Gbps"}]->(device2)
  CREATE (device)-[:HOSTS {vlan: 100}]->(subnet:Subnet)
  CREATE (incident:SecurityEvent)-[:AFFECTS]->(device)
  CREATE (policy:FirewallRule)-[:APPLIED_TO]->(device)

  Knowledge Base Categories:

  - Device Inventory: All Meraki/Fortinet equipment
  - Network Topology: Physical and logical connections
  - Configuration State: Current vs desired configurations
  - Performance Metrics: Historical trends and baselines
  - Security Posture: Policies, threats, vulnerabilities
  - Change History: Configuration changes and their impact

  🔧 Automated Remediation System
     Run comprehensive network assessments
  - Monitor device health in real-time
  - Receive intelligent alerts for issues
  - Get executive-level reporting with recommendations
  - Extend to the other options (B-E) when ready

proceed with the remaining options (Neo4j Knowledge Graph, Fortinet Integration, Dashboards, or Natural Language Management)
