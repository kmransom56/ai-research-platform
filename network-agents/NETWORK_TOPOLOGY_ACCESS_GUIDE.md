## 🗺️ **Step 2: Access Interactive Network Topology**

### **Neo4j Browser (Primary Interface)**
1. **Open**: http://localhost:7474
2. **Login**: 
   - Username: `neo4j`
   - Password: `password`
3. **Status**: ✅ Connection working

### **Essential Topology Queries**
Copy and paste these into Neo4j Browser:

**Complete Device Inventory:**
```cypher
MATCH (d:Device)
RETURN d.name as DeviceName, 
       d.model as Model, 
       d.platform as Platform,
       d.device_type as Type,
       d.status as Status,
       d.location as Location,
       d.health_score as HealthScore,
       d.cpu_usage as CPU,
       d.memory_usage as Memory
ORDER BY d.platform, d.health_score DESC;
```

**Network Topology Visualization:**
```cypher
MATCH (o:Organization)-[:HAS_NETWORK]->(n:Network)-[:CONTAINS]->(d:Device)
OPTIONAL MATCH (d)-[r:CONNECTED_TO|UPLINKS_TO]->(d2:Device)
RETURN o, n, d, d2, r;
```

**Critical Devices Needing Attention:**
```cypher
MATCH (d:Device)
WHERE d.health_score < 80 OR d.status <> 'online'
OPTIONAL MATCH (d)<-[:THREATENS]-(t:ThreatEvent)
OPTIONAL MATCH (d)-[:HAS_VULNERABILITY]->(v:Vulnerability)
RETURN d.name as Device,
       d.platform as Platform,
       d.health_score as HealthScore,
       d.status as Status,
       d.location as Location,
       d.issues as Issues,
       count(t) as SecurityThreats,
       count(v) as Vulnerabilities
ORDER BY d.health_score ASC;
```

**Network Connections & Physical Topology:**
```cypher
MATCH (d1:Device)-[r:CONNECTED_TO|UPLINKS_TO]->(d2:Device)
RETURN d1.name as Device1, 
       type(r) as ConnectionType, 
       r.connection_type as Medium,
       r.bandwidth as Bandwidth,
       d2.name as Device2,
       d1.location as Location1,
       d2.location as Location2;
```
