## 🎯 **How It Works**

1. **You Speak** → System listens through your microphone
2. **AI Understands** → Converts your speech to a network question  
3. **System Searches** → Looks up information in your network database
4. **AI Responds** → Speaks the answer back to you + shows on screen

**Example:**
- **You Say**: *"How many devices do we have?"*
- **AI Says Back**: *"You have 812 devices total in your network. Your biggest locations are: Inspire Brands: 399 devices, Buffalo Wild Wings: 100 devices, Comcast-Dunkin Donuts: 98 devices."*
