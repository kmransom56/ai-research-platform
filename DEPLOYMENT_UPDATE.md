- **Ports**: 11005 (SSL), 11006 (container)

## New Scripts & Automation

### Certificate Management Scripts
```bash
# CA server health monitoring
./scripts/infrastructure/check-ca-server-status.sh

# Certificate generation from CA
./scripts/infrastructure/request-ca-certificate.sh -d domain.local -p 11005 -s service

# Self-signed certificate generation
./scripts/infrastructure/generate-self-signed-cert.sh domain.local 11005

# Certificate renewal automation
./scripts/infrastructure/renew-ca-certificates.sh
```

### Application Management
```bash
# Standardized application addition
./scripts/platform-management/add-application.sh --name windmill --port 11005 --description "Workflow Automation"
```

## API Endpoints Integrated

### CA Server APIs (All Functional)
- `/api/generate-cert` - Certificate generation (200 OK)
- `/api/sign-csr` - CSR signing (200 OK)
- `/api/certificate-operations` - Certificate inventory (200 OK)
- `/api/download-cert` - Certificate download (200 OK)
- `/api/ca` - CA setup (200 OK)
- `/api/setup-chain` - Chain setup (200 OK)

## Configuration Updates

### Docker Compose
- Added Windmill services (server, worker, database)
- PostgreSQL database for Windmill
- Proper networking and dependencies

### Nginx Configuration

- Added certificate management workflows

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Test Windmill access
curl -k -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://localhost:11005

# Check CA server status
./scripts/infrastructure/check-ca-server-status.sh

# Verify certificate inventory
curl -k -s https://192.168.0.2/api/certificate-operations.disabled | jq '.summary'

# Platform health check
./scripts/platform-management/check-platform-status.sh
```
