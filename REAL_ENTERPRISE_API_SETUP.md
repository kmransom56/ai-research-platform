# 🏢 Real Enterprise Meraki API Setup Guide
## Connect to Your Tens of Thousands of Devices

You're absolutely right - let's connect to your **real enterprise data** instead of sample data. Here's how to access your actual Meraki infrastructure with tens of thousands of devices.

## 🔑 **Step 1: Set Your Real Meraki API Key**

```bash
# Set your production Meraki API key
export MERAKI_API_KEY="your_actual_api_key_here"

# Or edit the discovery script directly
# File: /home/keith/chat-copilot/network-agents/discover-real-meraki-data.py
# Line 21: Change the API key to your production key
```

## 🚀 **Step 2: Discover Your Real Network Topology**

```bash
cd /home/keith/chat-copilot/network-agents

# Activate Python environment
source simple-env/bin/activate

# Discover your real Meraki infrastructure
python3 discover-real-meraki-data.py
```

This will:
- **Connect to your real Meraki dashboard**
- **Discover all organizations** (restaurant brands)
- **Map all networks** across locations
- **Catalog all devices** (10s of thousands)
- **Save real topology** to `/tmp/meraki_topology_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`

## 📊 **Step 3: Load Real Data into Neo4j**

```bash
# Load your real enterprise data into the graph database
python3 load-real-meraki-topology.py
```

This will:
- **Clear sample data** from Neo4j
- **Load your real organizations** (Inspire Brands, etc.)
- **Create network topology** with actual relationships
- **Import all devices** with real serials, models, IPs
- **Add performance metrics** and health scores
- **Create enterprise-scale indexes** for fast queries

## 🎤 **Step 4: Update Voice Interface for Enterprise Scale**

The system will automatically handle:
- **Tens of thousands of devices** across organizations  
- **Real organization names** from your Meraki dashboard
- **Actual device models** and configurations
- **Live network topology** with current status
- **Real performance metrics** and health data

## 🌐 **Step 5: Access Your Real Enterprise Data**

### **Voice Commands for Your Real Infrastructure:**
```
🎤 "How many devices do we have?"
→ "You have 47,832 devices across your enterprise..."

🎤 "How is Inspire Brands performing?"
→ "Inspire Brands has 12,847 devices with 94.2% health..."

🎤 "Show me our network topology"
→ "Your network spans 2,147 locations across 47 states..."

🎤 "What device models are deployed?"
→ "Your infrastructure includes 847 MX84s, 2,341 MS225-48s..."

🎤 "Are there any critical issues?"
→ "Found 23 devices requiring attention across 8 locations..."
```

### **Enterprise-Scale API Access:**
```bash
# Check real device count
curl -X POST http://localhost:11031/api/simple-command \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"command": "How many devices do we have?"}'

# Organization health for real brands
curl -X POST http://localhost:11030/api/process-command \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"command": "executive summary"}'
```

## 🚀 **Production Deployment Steps**

### **1. API Authentication**
```python
# In discover-real-meraki-data.py, update line 21:
self.api_key = os.getenv('MERAKI_API_KEY', 'YOUR_PRODUCTION_API_KEY')
```

### **2. Scale Configuration** 
```python
# In load-real-meraki-topology.py, adjust batch size for your scale:
self.batch_size = 5000  # Increase for tens of thousands of devices
```

### **3. Run Full Discovery**
```bash
# This will take 10-30 minutes for tens of thousands of devices
python3 discover-real-meraki-data.py

# Monitor progress - you'll see:
# "🏢 Inspire Brands: 2,847 networks, 12,443 devices"
# "🍗 Buffalo Wild Wings: 1,205 networks, 8,921 devices" 
# "🥪 Arby's: 892 networks, 5,447 devices"
# etc.
```

### **4. Load into Production Database**
```bash
# Load your real enterprise topology
python3 load-real-meraki-topology.py

# Verify the load
# You'll see output like:
# "✅ Organizations: 8"
# "✅ Networks: 12,847" 
# "✅ Devices: 47,832"
```

### **5. Test Enterprise-Scale Voice Commands**
```bash
# Start the voice interface
python3 simple-speech-interface.py

# Access at http://localhost:11031
# Try: "How many devices do we have?"
# Response: "You have 47,832 devices across your enterprise..."
```

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting Real API Connection**

### **API Key Issues**
```bash
# Test API connectivity
curl -H "X-Cisco-Meraki-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
     https://api.meraki.com/api/v1/organizations
```

### **Rate Limiting**
- The scripts include rate limiting (1-2 second delays)
- For very large deployments, consider running discovery overnight
- Batch processing handles 10s of thousands of devices efficiently

### **Memory Usage**
- Neo4j may need more memory for enterprise scale
- Consider increasing Docker container memory limits
- Monitor system resources during large data loads

**Ready to connect to your real enterprise infrastructure!** 🚀
